# Package Installation

In order to make sure bootcamp runs smoothly, all necessary packages, programs, etc. should be installed before Day 1. To install all the necessary programs/packages follow the instructions in the accompanied notebook. 

**NOTE:** Github has issues rendering this notebook. If you view it as the accompanied .ipynb, github cannot source text and images properly. If you view the pdf on github specifically, it struggles to render the whole file and usually will cutoff around step 4.2 - there are 6 total steps. To view the full set of installation instructions: 1) select the Installations.pdf file 2) Click on the download button 3) Download the pdf to your local machine 4) View the downloaded instructions in your pdf viewer (adobe, edge, etc.) and you should be good to go.

If you run into any issues or have any questions/concerns feel free to shoot me an email: jtalwar@eng.ucsd.edu
