# Pre-Bootcamp Preparation
Wecome to the 2021 MSTP Bioinformatics Bootcamp! To ensure the bootcamp goes as smoothly as possible and we can cover as much material useful for you, we ask that you **generate SSH keys** and **install useful programs** (coming soon!)

If you run into any issues or have any questions/concerns feel free to shoot me an email: jtalwar@eng.ucsd.edu
